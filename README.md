# musescore-score-diff
Python package to visually compare two versions of the same score, and show their differences


Inspired by Greg Chapman and Francesco Fortino's "Music-score-diff" -- specialized for musescore files

NOTE: Maybe do music xml files ??

## General Idea
Will need both files in memory, hereinafter refered to as "score1" (old version) and "score2" (new version)

create a new score to show diffs on: "diff-score" that is a copy of "score1"
- copy over staves from score2 into `diff-score`, ideally next to its corresponding one (for score 2, have the staff be names `<staff>-1`).
then, for each staff pair (`<staff>` and `<staff>-1`):
- if one of the two is missing, the entire staff was added. Highlight the whole thing green/red somehow (indicate that the part was either created in this version or deleted in this version)
- if they both exist, go through each measure one at a time.
  - MVP: If a difference is found, highlight the entire measure red (old version) and green (new version) to indicate there was a difference
  - V2: Id a difference is found, mark the measure as changed (somehow, yellow?) go through the measure, and colour the individual elements to be red/green respectively
- In any case, mark that the instrument was changed
- at the end, for all changed instruments, create a new "part" for it containing both of the staves, label it `diff-<staff>`, this will be used to view the differences.
- Finally, save this new `diff-score` as `diff-<score-name>` and tell the user it has been done

(another celery task can export it, or user can do it themselves)


### steps for coloring notes / rests in musescore

add tag: `<color r="242" g="102" b="34" a="255"/>` to note

If its a rest or a barline, it can be inserted at index 1, notes are different for some reason

### Steps for highlighting measures:

Add tag to top ov voice (start of measures to be highlighted):
```
<Spanner type="TextLine">
  <TextLine>
    <eid>icWAADvE7ZE_UNlVmVRZvkP</eid>
    <linkedMain/>
    <diagonal>0</diagonal>
    <lineWidth>5</lineWidth>
    <color r="242" g="102" b="34" a="100"/>
    <Segment>
      <subtype>0</subtype>
      <offset x="0" y="2"/>
      <off2 x="0" y="0"/>
      <minDistance>-999</minDistance>
      <eid>nblchKlbnaD_7SJXnVEKpAF</eid>
      </Segment>
    </TextLine>
  <next>
    <location>
      <measures>1</measures>
      </location>
    </next>
  </Spanner>
```

measures is num measures the line lasts

Add tag to measure AFTER last measure to be highlighted
```
<Spanner type="TextLine">
  <prev>
    <location>
      <measures>-1</measures>
      </location>
    </prev>
  </Spanner>
```

NB Note:
- Maybe, instead of mapping by conductor score, we map by parts -- create a new part with diff score and process it that way


### Specs for musicXML:


`<score-part>` tags dictate how many different parts there are
`part` tags dictate the different parts (staves I assume?)
- `measure` tags all in parts,
